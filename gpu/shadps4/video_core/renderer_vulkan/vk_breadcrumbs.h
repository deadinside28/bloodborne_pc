// stuck in. Each scheduler is a stream: its draws, dispatches and our own passes are numbered in
// recording order, and the GPU writes 2n before command n and 2n+1 after it into a host-visible
// buffer (VK_AMD_buffer_marker at the bottom of the pipe: written once all earlier work of the
// queue has finished). On device lost the last value says which command never finished, and the
// notes kept here say what it was. BB_BREADCRUMBS=0 turns them off.
